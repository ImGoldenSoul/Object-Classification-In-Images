This project focuses on object classification in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary objective is to develop a system capable of predicting the class of an object present in any given input image. The system takes an arbitrary image as input, where the input is a 32x32 pixel image with three color channels (RGB), and provides a prediction result as output. The output is a classification label corresponding to one of the ten object classes in the CIFAR-10 dataset, which include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The CNN architecture was designed and trained to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing between these classes. The achieved results show promising accuracy, making this model suitable for further development and real-world applications.
